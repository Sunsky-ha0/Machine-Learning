## A.Linear Regression
  Linear regression is an approach to model the relationship between a single dependent variable (target variable) and one (simple regression) or more (multiple regression) independent variables. The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables.If this relationship is present, we can estimate the coefficients required by the model to make predictions on new data.

## B.Logistic Regression

## C.Dimensionality Reduction
  Reducing the number of random variables to consider.

## D.Back propagation
```diff
- Why it named back propagation ?
    We start by computing the δ^(out) term for the output layer and then we go back a layer to compute the δ^(hidden) term for the previous hidden layer and then we go back another step to compute δ for another hidden layer and so on. We'r sort of back propagating the errors from the output layer to the last hideen layer and another hidden layer until the input layer.
