## A.Linear Regression
  Linear regression is an approach to model the relationship between a single dependent variable (target variable) and one (simple regression) or more (multiple regression) independent variables. The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables.If this relationship is present, we can estimate the coefficients required by the model to make predictions on new data.
